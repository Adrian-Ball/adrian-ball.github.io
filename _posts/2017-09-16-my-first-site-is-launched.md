Hello, 

I am Adrian and this is my website. The reasons for building this site are two-fold. Firstly, I would like a place where I can present myself both professionally and personally. The idea is to not only have a place to present my curriculum vitae, but to also document interesting ideas and concepts. Secondly, I have never made a website before and this is an opportunity to learn something functional and new. 

As of writing this blog post up, the site is not too functional, but I am going to strive to update the site in some form on a regular basis.
