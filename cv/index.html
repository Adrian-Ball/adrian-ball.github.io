	<h3> Experience </h3>
		<h5> Research Associate, Rio Tinto Centre for Mine Automation</h5>
      <p> <i>January 2017 to present </i> </p>
      <p> In this research position I am exploring the application of machine learning techniques to develop probabilistic estimates of geological boundaries. I use real data to develop and extend probabilistic models of geological boundary representation, specifically through the use of Gaussian Processes. In this role I also maintain communication with others to present my research and to assist with the deployment of my work into production.</p>

		<h5> PhD (Human Robot Interaction), University of Sydney</h5>
			<p> <i> 2012 to 2016 </i> </p>
			<p> In my PhD I formulated a research project to contribute new work to the body of human
			knowledge. As part of my experimental design work, I had to look at the acquisition and
			analysis of noisy data to develop a usable and statistically sound model of user comfort
			for robot approach directions. Specifically, I had to develop a process for analysing non-parametric participant response data with both linear and directional statistical models so that
			an understanding of how pairs of people found different robot approach paths comfortable
			can be reached. Other required and developed skills during my PhD include self-motivation,
			experimental design, ability to work as part of a team, and a strong ability to communicate
			clearly. Details of the PhD are covered in Education.
			</p>

		<h5> Masters by Research (Human Robot Interaction), University of Sydney</h5>
      <p> <i> 2010 to 2012 </i> </p>
			<p> In the Masters by Research, I developed skills similar to that of the PhD, with the primary difference
			being the size of the project undertaken. Details of the Masters are also covered in Education.
			</p>

		<h5> University Tutor (Teachers Assistant), University of Sydney </h5>
			<p> <i> 2010 to 2016 </i> </p>
			<p> <i> Recipient of the Faculty Tutoring Award</i> </p>
			<p> As a tutor, I assisted with the running of tutorials and laboratory sessions. This role requires preparatory work for the classes and marking. On occasions, I also generated and presented class lectures.
			</p>
			<p>
			Main courses tutored:
				<ul>
			<li>Mechatronics 1; First year course on programming and digital logic.
			<li>Mechatronics 3: Third year micro-controller course focusing on system design, development
			and implementation
			<li>System Dynamics and Control: Third year course on classical linear time invariant systems
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			I have also assisted in an unofficial capacity with the supervision of undergraduate thesis students
			in mechatronic engineering. Some duties of this position include working with the students
			in experiment design, robot design, data analysis, and to assist in developing their research
			skills to produce a thesis. Common tasks included meeting with the students, discussing
			ideas, and the development of research-based skills such as performing a literature review
			and writing in an academic style.
			</p>

		<h5> Language Editor, Paladyn Journal of Behavioural Robotics</h5>
			<p> <i> 2012 to 2015 </i> </p>
			<p> This was a voluntary position to occasionally review submitted articles and assist with language editing. Articles were requested for review intermittently throughout the year.
			</p>

	<h3> Education </h3>

  <h5> PhD - Australian Center of Field Robotics, The University of Sydney</h5>
    <p> <b> Quantitative Analysis of Group Comfort when Approach by a Robot</b></p>
    <p> <i> 2012 to 2016 </i> </p>
    <p> <i> Recipient of the Australian Postgraduate Award, Research Scholarship from the Australian Government</i> </p>
    <p> This thesis explored how comfortable pairs of people are when approached by a mobile robot from different directions. The primary contributions of this work are quantitative analyses of of experiment results showing how group comfort differs from that of a lone individual, and how intra-group orientation changes individual comfort responses. A secondary contribution is the introduction of directional statistics to the field of HRI and demonstrating its use as an informative data analysis method.
    </p>
    <p>The core of this thesis focused on the design of an experiment that would produce participant data in a form that could then be passed through non-parametric linear and directional statistic pipelines. This process involved the programming and verification of statistical tests before using the process to analyse participant data acquired from performed experiments. The results of the process then had to be communicated to relevant audiences through both presentations and technical documentation.
    </p>

<h5> Masters by Research - Australian Center of Field Robotics, The University of Sydney</h5>
    <p> <b> Human Recognition Through Gait Analysis Using an Inexpensive Visual Sensor</b></p>
    <p> <i> 2010 to 2012 </i> </p>
    <p> This thesis investigated the capability of the Kinect to recognise people based on their gait in an open-plan office environment. The experiment was then emulated with a motion capture system to help identify shortfalls with the Kinect. Machine learning techniques are employed to show that while the Kinect is outperformed by state-of-the-art sensors, there is potential for it to be used as a cheap sensor for gait based human identification.
    </p>

<h5> Bachelor of Mechatronic Engineering (Honours) - The University of Sydney</h5>
  <p> <i> 2004 to 2009 </i> </p>

<h5> Bachelor of Science (Double Major in Advanced Mathematics) - The University of Sydney</h5>
  <p> <i> 2004 to 2009 </i> </p>
