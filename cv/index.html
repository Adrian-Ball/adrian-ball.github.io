		<h5> Research Associate, Rio Tinto Centre for Mine Automation</h5>
      <p> <i>January 2017 to present </i> </p>
      <p> In this research position I am exploring the application of machine learning techniques to develop probabilistic estimates of geological surfaces. I use real data to develop and extend probabilistic models of geological surface representation, specifically through the use of Gaussian Processes. In this role I also maintain communication with others to present my research and to assist with deployment of my work into production.</p>

  <h5> PhD - Australian Center of Field Robotics, The University of Sydney</h5>
    <p> <b> Quantitative Analysis of Group Comfort when Approach by a Robot</b></p>
    <p> <i> 2012 to 2016 </i> </p>
    <p> <i> Recipient of the Australian Postgraduate Award, Research Scholarship from the Australian Government</i> </p>
    <p> This thesis explored how comfortable pairs of people are when approached by a mobile robot from different directions. The primary contributions of this work are quantitative analyses of of experiment results showing how group comfort differs from that of a lone individual, and how intra-group orientation changes individual comfort responses. A secondary contribution is the introduction of directional statistics to the field of HRI and demonstrating its use as an informative data analysis method.
    </p>
    <p>The core of this thesis focused on the design of an experiment that would produce participant data in a form that could then be passed through non-parametric linear and directional statistic pipelines. This process involved the programming and verification of statistical tests before using the process to analyse participant data acquired from performed experiments. The results of the process then had to be communicated to relevant audiences through both presentations and technical documentation.

<h5> Masters by Research - Australian Center of Field Robotics, The University of Sydney</h5>
    <p> <b> Human Recognition Through Gait Analysis Using an Inexpensive Visual Sensor</b></p>
    <p> <i> 2010 to 2012 </i> </p>
    <p> This thesis investigated the capability of the Kinect to recognise people based on their gait in an open-plan office environment. The experiment was then emulated with a motion capture system to help identify shortfalls with the Kinect. Machine learning techniques are employed to show that while the Kinect is outperformed by state-of-the-art sensors, there is potential for it to be used as a cheap sensor for gait based human identification.
