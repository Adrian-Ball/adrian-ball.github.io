		<h5> PhD (Human Robot Interaction), University of Sydney</h5>
			<p> <i> 2012 to 2016 </i> </p>
			<!--<p> In my PhD I formulated a research project to contribute new work to the body of human
			knowledge. As part of my experimental design work, I had to look at the acquisition and
			analysis of noisy data to develop a usable and statistically sound model of user comfort
			for robot approach directions. Specifically, I had to develop a process for analysing non-parametric participant response data with both linear and directional statistical models so that an understanding of how pairs of people found different robot approach paths comfortable can be reached. Other required and developed skills during my PhD include self-motivation, experimental design, ability to work as part of a team, and a strong ability to communicate clearly. Details of the PhD are covered in Education.

	<h3> Education </h3>

  <h5> PhD - Australian Center of Field Robotics, The University of Sydney</h5>
    <p> <b> How Should a Robot Approach a Pair of People?</b></p>
    <p> <i> 2012 to 2016 </i> </p>
    <p> <i> Recipient of the Australian Postgraduate Award, Research Scholarship from the Australian Government</i> </p>
    <p> This thesis explored how comfortable pairs of people are when approached by a mobile robot from different directions. The primary contributions of this work are quantitative analyses of of experiment results showing how group comfort differs from that of a lone individual, and how intra-group orientation changes individual comfort responses. A secondary contribution is the introduction of directional statistics to the field of HRI and demonstrating its use as an informative data analysis method.
    </p>
    <p>The core of this thesis focused on the design of an experiment that would produce participant data in a form that could then be passed through non-parametric linear and directional statistic pipelines. This process involved the programming and verification of statistical tests before using the process to analyse participant data acquired from performed experiments. The results of the process then had to be communicated to relevant audiences through both presentations and technical documentation.
    </p>

<h5> Masters by Research - Australian Center of Field Robotics, The University of Sydney</h5>
    <p> <b> Human Recognition Through Gait Analysis Using an Inexpensive Visual Sensor</b></p>
    <p> <i> 2010 to 2012 </i> </p>
    <p> This thesis investigated the capability of the Kinect to recognise people based on their gait in an open-plan office environment. The experiment was then emulated with a motion capture system to help identify shortfalls with the Kinect. Machine learning techniques are employed to show that while the Kinect is outperformed by state-of-the-art sensors, there is potential for it to be used as a cheap sensor for gait-based human identification.
